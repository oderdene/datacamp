### How does Git store information?
In order to make common operations fast and minimize storage space, Git uses a multi-level structure to store data. In simplified form, this has three key parts:

1. Every unique version of every file. (Git calls these blobs because they can contain data of any kind.)
2. tree that tracks the names and locations of a set of files.
3. A commit that records the author, log message, and other properties of a particular commit.

As the diagram shows, each blob is stored only once, and blobs are (frequently) shared between trees. While it may seem redundant to have both trees and commits, a later part of this lesson will show why the two have to be distinct.


### What is a hash?
Every commit to a repository has a unique identifier called a hash (since it is generated by running the changes through a pseudo-random number generator called a hash function). This hash is normally written as a 40-character hexadecimal string like `7c35a3ce607a14953f070f0f83b5d74c2296ef93`, but most of the time, you only have to give Git the first 6 or 8 characters in order to identify the commit you mean.

Hashes are what enable Git to share data efficiently between repositories. If two files are the same, their hashes are guaranteed to be the same. Similarly, if two commits contain the same files and have the same ancestors, their hashes will be the same as well. Git can therefore tell what information needs to be saved where by comparing hashes rather than comparing entire files.

### How can I view a specific commit?
To view the details of a specific commit, you use the command `git show` with the first few characters of the commit's hash. For example, the command `git show 043070` produces this:

The first part is the same as the log entry shown by `git log`. The second part shows the changes; as with `git diff`, lines that the change removed are prefixed with `-`, while lines that it added are prefixed with `+`.

### What is Git's equivalent of a relative path?
A hash is like an absolute path: it identifies a specific commit. Another way to identify a commit is to use the equivalent of a relative path. The special label `HEAD`, which we saw in the previous chapter, always refers to the most recent commit. The label `HEAD~1` then refers to the commit before it, while `HEAD~2` refers to the commit before that, and so on.

Note that the symbol between `HEAD` and the number is a tilde `~`, not a minus sign `-`, and that there cannot be spaces before or after the tilde.

### How can I see what changed between two commits?
`git show` with a commit ID shows the changes made in a particular commit. To see the changes between two commits, you can use `git diff ID1..ID2`, where ID1 and ID2 identify the two commits you're interested in, and the connector .. is a pair of dots. For example, `git diff abc123..def456` shows the differences between the commits abc123 and def456, while `git diff HEAD~1..HEAD~3` shows the differences between the state of the repository one commit in the past and its state three commits in the past.

### How do I tell Git to ignore certain files?
Data analysis often produces temporary or intermediate files that you don't want to save. You can tell it to stop paying attention to files you don't care about by creating a file in the root directory of your repository called `.gitignore` and storing a list of wildcard patterns that specify the files you don't want Git to pay attention to. For example, if .gitignore contains:
```
build
*.mpl
```
then Git will ignore any file or directory called `build` (and, if it's a directory, anything in it), as well as any file whose name ends in `.mpl`.

### How can I remove unwanted files?
Git can help you clean up files that you have told it you don't want. The command `git clean -n` will show you a list of files that are in the repository, but whose history Git is not currently tracking. A similar command `git clean -f` will then delete those files.

Use this command carefully: `git clean` only works on untracked files, so by definition, their history has not been saved. If you delete them with `git clean -f`, they're gone for good.

### How can I see how Git is configured?
Like most complex pieces of software, Git allows you to change its default settings. To see what the settings are, you can use the command `git config --list` with one of three additional options:

* `--system`: settings for every user on this computer.
* `--global`: settings for every one of your projects.
* `--local`: settings for one specific project.
Each level overrides the one above it, so local settings (per-project) take precedence over global settings (per-user), which in turn take precedence over system settings (for all users on the computer).

### How can I change my Git configuration?
Most of Git's settings should be left as they are. However, there are two you should set on every computer you use: your name and your email address. These are recorded in the log every time you commit a change, and are often used to identify the authors of a project's content in order to give credit (or assign blame, depending on the circumstances).

To change a configuration value for all of your projects on a particular computer, run the command:
```
git config --global setting.name setting.value
```
with the setting's name and value in the appropriate places. The keys that identify your name and email address are `user.name` and `user.email` respectively.

```
git config --global user.email odko@gmail.com
```
