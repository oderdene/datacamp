### How can I tell what I have changed?

Git has a staging area in which it stores files with changes you want to save that haven't been saved yet. Putting files in the staging area is like putting things in a box, while committing those changes is like putting that box in the mail: you can add more things to the box or take things out as often as you want, but once you put it in the mail, you can't make further changes.

```
git status
git diff .
```

`git status` shows you which files are in this staging area, and which files have changes that haven't yet been put there. In order to compare the file as it currently is to what you last saved, you can use `git diff filename` . `git diff` without any filenames will show you all the changes in your repository, while `git diff directory` will show you the changes to the files in some directory.


### What's the first step in saving changes?

You commit changes to a Git repository in two steps:

1. Add one or more files to the staging area.
2. Commit everything in the staging area.

To add a file to the staging area, use `git add filename `.


### How can I tell what's going to be committed?

To compare a file's current state to the changes in the staging area, you can use `git diff -r HEAD path/to/file`. The `-r` flag means "compare to a particular revision", `HEAD` is a shortcut meaning "the most recent commit", and the path to the file is the relative to where you are (for example, the path from the root directory of the repository). We will explore other uses of `-r` and `HEAD` in the next chapter.

* Ctrl-K: delete a line.
* Ctrl-U: un-delete a line.
* Ctrl-O: save the file ('O' stands for 'output').
* Ctrl-X: exit the editor.


### How do I commit changes?
To save the changes in the staging area, you use the command `git commit`. It always saves everything that is in the staging area as one unit: as you will see later, when you want to undo changes to a project, you undo all of a commit or none of it.

```
git commit -m "Program appears to have become self-aware."
```

### How can I view a repository's history?

The command `git log` is used to view the log of the project's history.
The `commit` line displays a unique ID for the commit called a hash;

The other lines tell you who made the change, when, and what log message they wrote for the change.

When you run `git log`, Git automatically uses a pager to show one screen of output at a time. Press the `space bar` to go down a page or the 'q' key to quit.


### How can I view a specific file's history?

A project's entire log can be overwhelming, so it's often useful to inspect only the changes to particular files or directories. You can do this using `git log path`, where `path` is the path to a specific file or directory. The log for a file shows changes made to that file; the log for a directory shows when files were added or deleted in that directory, rather than when the contents of the directory's files were changed.
