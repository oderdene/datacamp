### What is a branch?
One of the reasons Git is popular is its support for creating branches. A branch is like a parallel universe: changes you make in one branch do not affect other branches until you merge them back together. It's like creating sub-directories called `final`, `final-updated`, `final-updated-revised`, and so on, but with support for tracking work systematically.

Note: the first chapter described the three-part data structure Git uses to record a repository's history: blobs for files, trees for the saved states of the repositories, and commits to record the changes. Branches are the reason Git needs both trees and commits: a commit will have two parents when branches are being merged.

### How can I see what branches my repository has?
By default, every Git repository has a branch called `master` (which is why you have been seeing that word in Git's output in previous lessons). To list all of the branches in a repository, you can run the command `git branch`. The branch you are currently in will be shown with a `*` beside its name.


### How can I view the differences between branches?
Branches and revisions are closely connected, and commands that work on the latter usually work on the former. For example, just as `git diff revision-1..revision-2` shows the difference between two versions of a repository, `git diff branch-1..branch-2` shows the difference between two branches.

### How can I switch from one branch to another?
When you run git branch, it puts a `*` beside the name of the branch you are currently in. To switch to another branch, you use `git checkout branch-name`.

Note: Git will only let you do this if all of your changes have been committed. You can get around this, but it is outside the scope of this course.


### How can I create a branch?
The easiest way to create a new branch is to run `git checkout -b branch-name`, which creates the branch and switches you to it. The contents of the new branch are initially identical to the contents of the original. Once you start making changes, they only affect the new branch.


### How can I merge two branches?
Branching lets you create parallel universes; merging is how you bring them back together. When you merge one branch (call it the source) into another (call it the destination), Git incorporates the changes made to the source branch into the destination branch. If those changes don't overlap, the result is a new commit in the destination branch that includes everything from the source branch. (The next exercises describes what happens if there are conflicts.)

To merge two branches, you run `git merge source destination` (without `..` between the two branch names). Git automatically opens an editor so that you can write a log message for the merge; you can either keep its default message or fill in something more informative.

### What are conflicts?
